open, close, high, low, volume = standard definitions for daily price and volume data vwap = daily volume-weighted average price
cap = market cap
vwap = daily volume-weighted average price
adv{d} = average daily dollar volume for the past d days


rank(x) = cross-sectional rank
delta(x, d) = today’s value of x minus the value of x d days ago
correlation(x, y, d) = time-serial correlation of x and y for the past d days

delay(x, d) = value of x d days ago
covariance(x, y, d) = time-serial covariance of x and y for the past d days
scale(x, a) = rescaled x such that sum(abs(x)) = a (the default is a = 1)
signedpower(x, a) = x^a
decay_linear(x, d) = weighted moving average over the past d days with linearly decaying weightsd,d–1,...,1(rescaledtosumupto1)
indneutralize(x, g) = x cross-sectionally neutralized against groups g (subindustries, industries, sectors, etc.), i.e., x is cross-sectionally demeaned within each group g
ts_{O}(x, d) = operator O applied across the time-series for the past d days; non-integer number of days d is converted to floor(d)
ts_min(x, d) = time-series min over the past d days
ts_max(x, d) = time-series max over the past d days ts_argmax(x, d) = which day ts_max(x, d) occurred on ts_argmin(x, d) = which day ts_min(x, d) occurred on ts_rank(x, d) = time-series rank in the past d days min(x, d) = ts_min(x, d)
max(x, d) = ts_max(x, d)
sum(x, d) = time-series sum over the past d days
product(x, d) = time-series product over the past d days
stddev(x, d) = moving time-series standard deviation over the past d days
